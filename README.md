# myFirstApp-upgraded_version
                              This is the upgraded version of myFirstApp.
                              That android app had some drawbacks and crashed if we enter a huge number but in this upgrade version it doesn't.
                              The rest of the functions of the app are similar to the myFirstApp,changes weren't made on the basic functionality of the app.
